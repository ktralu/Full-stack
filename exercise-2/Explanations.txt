1. React: React is a front-end JavaScript toolkit that is free and open-source for creating user interfaces 
based on UI components. It is kept up-to-date by Meta and a group of independent programmers and businesses.

2.React component: Components are solitary, replaceable parts of code. They accomplish the same thing as 
JavaScript functions, except they operate independently and output HTML such as Class component, Function
component, Rendering component and so on.

3.Single page application: These days, it is a highly popular method of website programming. The intention is 
for the website to load all of the HTML and JS on your first time. The browser will just enter the information 
without refreshing the website when you navigate after that.

4.Declarative programming (versus imperative programming): Declarative programming is a paradigm that describes 
what the program does rather than stating the control flow in detail. A programming paradigm known as imperative 
programming describes what the program should be doing by clearly defining each command (or statement) 
step-by-step, changing the program's state.

5.JSX: JavaScript XML is referred to as JSX. We can write HTML in React according to JSX. React use of JSX makes 
adding and writing HTML smoother.

6.Asynchronous (versus synchronous): Synchronous code executes in order. This implies that before beginning an 
operation, it must wait for the previous one to finish. Code that is asynchronous executes concurrently. This 
implies that an operation may take place whilst another is being completed.
